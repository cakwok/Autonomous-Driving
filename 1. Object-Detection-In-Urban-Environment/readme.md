Project overview: This section should contain a brief description of the project and what we are trying to achieve. Why is object detection such an important component of self-driving car systems?
Set up: This section should contain a brief description of the steps to follow to run the code for this repository.

To understand scenes by knowing the presence of pederstrians, vechicles, objects, the model computer vision approach is to detect objects with bounding box and class label regression.  In this project, 

Dataset
Dataset Analysis: This section should contain a quantitative and qualitative description of the dataset. It should include images, charts, and other visualizations.
Cross-validation: This section should detail the cross-validation strategy and justify your approach.
Training

Reference experiment: This section should detail the results of the reference experiment. It should include training metrics, Tensorboard charts, and a detailed explanation of the algorithm's performance.
Improve on the reference: This section should highlight the different strategies you adopted to improve your model. It should contain relevant figures and details of your findings.
Once you have everything ready and have checked your deliverables against everything in the rubric, you can click the "Submit Project" button on this page.
