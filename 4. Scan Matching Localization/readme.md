## SLAM

The objective of this project is to generate an accurate 3D point cloud map of the simulated environment by continuously scanning with a virtual lidar mounted on an autonomous vehicle simulator. The collected scans are added to the map as the vehicle moves, and the goal is to match new scans with the map using ICP to estimate the vehicle's pose with less than 1.2m pose error.
