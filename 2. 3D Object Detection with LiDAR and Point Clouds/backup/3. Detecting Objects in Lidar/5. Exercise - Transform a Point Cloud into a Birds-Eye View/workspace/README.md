# Exercise C2-3-2

## Files to work in:

- `basic_loop.py`
- `lesson-2-object-detection/exercises/starter/l2_exercises.py`

Implement the `pcl_to_bev()` function. Note that you will also need inputs from Example C2-3-1 uncommented in `basic_loop.py`.

## Running the Code

Run `basic_loop.py` in the `nd013-c2-fusion-exercises` directory once you have implemented your code. You will need the Desktop window open to view the visualization; **use the Escape key to progress from frame to frame.**
