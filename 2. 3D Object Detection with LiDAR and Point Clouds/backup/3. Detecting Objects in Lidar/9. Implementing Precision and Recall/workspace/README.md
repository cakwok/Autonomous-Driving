# L2 Examples

It's important to note that certain examples in this lesson make use of the outputs of other examples.

For instance, Example C2-3-3 (and Exercise C2-3-2 before it) use the output of Example C2-3-1.

Otherwise, it is often preferred to comment back out previous examples/exercises so you don't have to cycle through all of the related visualizations.

## Use the Escape Key!

To traverse frames, you may need to use the Escape key to progress frames. In limited instances, closing a given frame visualization by clicking on the X of the window may also traverse frames.

## Special Note

In Example C2-4-3, add `True` as an additional argument to `render_bb_over_bev()` for visualization, but remove it when using Example C2-4-4.
