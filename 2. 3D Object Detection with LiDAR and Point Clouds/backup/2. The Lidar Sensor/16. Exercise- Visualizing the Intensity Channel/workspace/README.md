# Exercise C1-5-5

## Files to work in:
- `basic_loop.py` 
- `lesson1-lidar-sensor/exercises/starter/l1_exercises.py`

Implement the `vis_intensity_channel()` function.

## Running the Code

Run `python basic_loop.py` from within the `nd013-c2-fusion-exercises` directory when you have implemented your code.

Note that you'll need to make use of the Desktop window (see button in bottom right of the workspace if working directly in the terminal) to view the visualization output, and use the Escape key to progress through frames.
